# Movie-Trailer-Website
### (Project-1 of Udacity's Full Stack Web Devleopment)

**This project involves making a dynamic website using python data structures. You will find the list of my favorite movies in the dynamic website created by Python script.**

## How to Run?
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Delete **Crisp_tomatoes.html** (You will be creating your own in the next step. This is just to show output.)
3. Run `python entertainment_center.py` if you have python installed on your device (if not, check Prerequisites).
4. You will be opened with a webpage which is dynamically created using python scripts.

## Prerequisites:
 1. Python 2.x.x, if not installed on your system, [Install python](https://www.python.org)
 **You should have Python and a Web browser(Google Chrome) installed on your computer before running this project.**
 
## Moving over project files:
 **1. media.py:** This file has **class Movie** defined inside it, which will be used to make instances and populate the webpage later.
 
 **2. entertainment_center_py:** This file has the data for all the movies and will pass the list of **Movie** instances to Crsip_tomatoes.py to populate the page with the data.
 
 **3. crisp_tomatoes:** This file has all the HTML and CSS. This is the main file responsible for webpage creation with the data sent by enterainment_center.py. This file will create and open a **Crisp_tomatoes.html** in your browser(in case it doesn't open webpage, use a browser to open **Crsip_tomatoes.html**), which will be the final output of this project.
